It keeps your baby drier, longer, and ensures healthy skin, better sleep, and fewer leaks and blowouts.

Coterie was recently named The Best Diaper by one of the top parenting media sites, The Bump.

Recruiting Manager at Customer.io

Send InMail

Hi, I'm Will, Principal Data Analyst at Customer.io, currently the sole member of our Business Intelligence team, and I'm looking for a partner.




As the second member of our Business Intelligence team we'll work together to curate our data, uncover insights, and create dashboards. By helping stakeholders across our team understand how each element of the business is operating, you'll help us move smarter and faster.




You'll be a consultant and trusted advisor to folks across our Operations, Product, Marketing, Sales and Customers Teams. While data helps inform many decisions at Customer.io, it’s one factor alongside other things like customer research, our experience, and intuition. You won’t find us running experiments to figure out which of 50 shades of blue is the best one for a button color! You'll be helping us make decisions that matter.




A bit about how we work...

We get data into our Snowflake warehouse though a mix of scalable SaaS tools (Stitch, Segment) and engineering-managed data pipelines for data generated by our App. We curate that raw data into an analytics layer using dbt and then build charts and dashboards using Mode and PopSQL. Sometimes we'll take that data into Sheets to build a forecast or pipe it into a tool like Sisu for more exploration. We're always interested in exploring new ways to unearth insights.




As a Data Analyst, you will...

Help our Sales Development team understand which prospective customers are most likely to convert.
Help our Product team understand how our new EU datacenter impacts customer demographics.
Help our Customers team understand the value of Customer Success Managers
Help our Technical Support team build a hiring forecast




You are...

An independent problem-solver, but aren’t afraid to ask for help or collaboration when you need to.
Curious, inquisitive, and constantly seeking to understand how things work.
Capable of digging through the weeds to find a nugget of insight, but willing to step back before you've lost a week to a fruitless search.
Empathetic and able to put yourself into the shoes of your stakeholders to better understand what they care about and help them answer the questions they may not yet know they need to ask.
You know how to build and maintain clean, intuitive datasets that will enable you to answer new questions quickly and accurately.
A strong communicator - particularly in written form since clear writing will be important to sharing your insights with others across our distributed team.
Based in UTC -4 to -7 (North or South America) to maximize working hours overlap.




What we're looking for

Fluency in SQL to query and (bonus!) dbt to transform data.
Experience with data analysis across different company functions, even if you didn't have a ""data analyst"" title.
Experience communicating complex analyses in digestible ways to a non-technical audience.




Ideally, but not required...

You’ve used tools in our stack like: DBT, Snowflake, Mode, Stitch Data, Segment.
You've worked with Product Analytics tools like Mixpanel and Amplitude.




About Customer.io

Our mission at Customer.io is to power automated communication that people like to receive. Today over 2,600 internet businesses use Customer.io to manage, send, and track performance of email, SMS, and push notifications. Unlike typical marketing platforms, Customer.io helps businesses increase relevance by using behavioral data: what people do or don’t do when logged in to a web or mobile app.

We are offering a starting salary of $91,500 - $135,000 USD depending on experience and subject to market rate.




Benefits at Customer.io include:

20 days PTO - we offer 20 vacation days (in addition to holidays and sick days) so that you can unwind, unplug, and recharge
100% medical, dental, vision, and supplemental insurance for you and your dependents
12 weeks paid parental leave - for birth, adoption, or foster care
Health and wellness allowance - Up to $200 USD per month that can be used for your healthy living needs, including gym membership, acupuncture, massage, or bike repairs
Home office stipend - Up to $2,000 USD to help you get your home office set up so you can do your best work
Internet + cell phone reimbursement - Up to $200 USD per month for your internet and cell phone plans
Co-working space reimbursement - Up to $300 USD per month for those times you'd prefer to work in a co-working environment
Learning + development - Up to $2,000 USD reimbursement per year to use on conferences, books, classes, or workshops - anything that will help you develop your skills
1 month paid sabbatical after four years at Customer.io - to treat yourself to a vacation, or spend however you choose
Company retreats twice a year - we typically get together IRL every spring and fall, but most recently had an amazing virtual retreat!
Flexible schedule, work anywhere you want! - as long as you have a reliable internet connection and some overlapping work time with your manager, you can work where and when you want




All final candidates will be asked to complete an employment and education verification authorization form (which allows us to verify your job history and education listed on your resume) as part of our pre-employment process.




Customer.io recognizes the stifling impact of systemic injustice on diverse communities. We commit to using our influence to increase inclusion and equity within the tech industry. We strive to build an inclusive team culture, implement bias-free hiring practices, and develop community partnerships to expand our global impact.

2618625313,"About Census 🔃

Census is how data teams at companies like Figma, Notion, Rippling, Clearbit, and Fivetran build better business operations.

With Census, analysts can turn their data warehouse into a single source of truth and publish their insights directly into the apps that marketing & sales teams use daily. With live data, these teams can build better campaigns, understand what users are doing, and ultimately drive more sustainable revenue.

We're a tight-knit team of engineers based in San Francisco who love taking annoying problems most people avoid and building elegant solutions for them. We believe that data should be used for more than just making charts. This is why we built the first integration platform that works directly within cloud data warehouses.

Your Mission 🚀

We're looking for our very first Customer Data Architect. Everyone at Census cares about making our customers’ job easier, faster, and more rewarding. But that's literally your full time job. You are our customers' support crew. You have their back, and make sure they’ve got the tools and knowledge they need to get their work done.

To help our customers, we need to understand everything about our customers. You'll be in charge of building a real relationship with each customer. Their KPIs are your KPIs so you'll need to understand their business even better than they do and then helping them build solutions using Census, dbt, data warehouses, and the rest of the modern data stack. You'll be on the bleeding edge of analytics engineering, helping everyone else make sure they're building the right thing.

This is the chance for you to define the role and build the team from the ground up. Both working directly with our customers day to day and helping us design what the function looks like as we grow.

Your responsibilities 🗓

Building relationships with prospective, understanding what they’re trying to accomplish.
Helping new customers get started with Census and get the most out of it over time.
Working with high priority customers to recommend best practices and architect their Census data flows.
Writing SQL as examples or to directly provide solutions to customers.
Meet with new and existing customers where they are: over email, Slack, and Zoom. Or in the wider data community (hi dbt slack friends!)
Converting interesting ideas, patterns, and lessons into written and video content to help the entire community.
Partnering with the engineering team to debug issues and represent customers best interests in product planning.


Is this you? ⚡️

Here's What Our Dream Candidate Looks Like

Data Analysis background – Direct experience writing advanced SQL to analyze arbitrary data sets (you know the stuff: aggregates, CTEs, window functions, etc). Bonus points for experience using any of the tools in the modern data stack.
Technical problem solving – Love to nerd out on technical problems, creative out of the box thinking about solutions.
Curiosity – Interest in learning and exploring, experimenting, and teaching others.
Emotional Intelligence (EQ) – Genuine desire to see other people succeed and help them get there.
Self-motivation – Desire to work in a startup environment without the structure of big companies.
Based in the Bay Area or willing to relocate (when things like offices and travel are allowed again).


Benefits 🏆

Full medical and dental insurance coverage
Flexible hours
Generous vacation policy

Dandy's Data program is racing to catch up to the rest of the company. Dandy has extraordinarily complex operational and technical challenges (and some very impressive people working to meet these challenges) - data is one of the central keys to its success. The opportunities for personal growth in this position are extremely high. You will be pushed to the edge of your comfort zone but strongly supported technically and organizationally by a kind, diverse, low ego, extremely intelligent, extremely effective team. Dandy is an extremely high growth startup - though the company is on a rocketship trajectory, it is still early enough to get started within the positive environment of a smaller organization.

Data analysts own everything from data stewardship through to strategy analysis, including: structuring the problem and key metrics, data capture design, analytic frameworks, product design analysis, data/analysis accessibility for business partners, deep-dive strategic analyses. Your role will be problem(s)-based, and will likely involve driving all of these components. Data analysts here become relatively independent technically - we say that our analysts are ""full stack"". We serve every department in the company.

About Dandy

Dandy is a business-in-a-box for dentists. Our vision is to become the operating system for every dental office in America by leading the transition to digital dentistry for the $200 billion industry.

Data Analytics and Data Science are a fundamental part of Dandy's core offerings and are key pillars for its success. We are constantly adding new product offerings or taking over more pieces of our (very complex) supply chain, and we suspect that there will be plenty of very interesting fundamental data problems for a very long time.

About Dandy Data

Dandy's data program is newly led by a team with a proven track record of building data practices at hypergrowth companies. We are all aligned on the mission of propelling the company to market dominance. Simultaneously, we also believe that promoting individual growth is part and parcel of this mission and the best way to achieve success. Whether you want to grow technically (self-directed training days every quarter, technical discussions at dandy run from analytics tools through to ML for point-cloud image segmentation) or organizationally (all work is highly cross functional, we want you to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible, opportunities for management exist as well if that interests you) we think Dandy is the place for you. You will be strongly supported in pushing your comfort zone as far out as makes sense, and the opportunities for doing that here are much more numerous than most places. We also have some pretty cool custom Data infrastructure and tooling which we like to think makes every analyst on our team several times more effective than under a regular paradigm.

Responsibilities

Own every part of the data and strategy cycle for your problem(s) - data capture design, strategy and metrics development, analytics frameworks, accessible reporting, coaching of business stakeholders, deep dive analyses, etc
Be a cross functional leader, bringing together all business groups and technical groups to get the job done
Own your problem space itself. Be a full partner to business/technical stakeholders.


Ask the questions no one has thought of, and figure out when a full reframing might be necessary.

Own all data delivery and reporting for your space



Requirements

Technical dexterity: you will get up to speed on SQL + very basic python in your first few days and then add on new tools/methods/etc thereafter as is relevant to your problem space
Analytic mind and methodical approach.
You onboard onto new business problems quickly and can think just like your stakeholders.
Ability to understand a complex problem space quickly from angles such as data capture, data availability/accessibility/communication, product design, process design, machine intelligence techniques for scaling
Desire to work cross functionally and learn how to lead cross functional projects
Communication: (1) you already communicate effectively with a technical audience (2) you cam communicate effectively and independently with a wide range of non-technical stakeholders and desire to keep improving here
Track record of ownership
Track record of curiosity and motivation
Dentistry experience is not required!


Bonus Points

DBT + Looker + python experience
Advanced experience in any of the above requirements
Basic ML
Direct experience in Data Analytics
An advanced technical degree"

In the past year, over 30 million people has lost their jobs, and with Workstream, we have the opportunity to take part in the 2021 Great Re-hiring to help millions of people to get jobs faster and to help local businesses re-open and re-hire.




Here is an article where we wrote about it - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/2021-great-rehiring-desmond-lim

About the Role:




Responsibilities




- You will be responsible for building, restructuring, & monitoring/ maintaining ELT pipelines between our GTM tools used within the company. These currently include Salesforce, Segment, Outreach, Stripe, production data, etc., with many more coming on the horizon as we grow the complexity and capability of our business.




- You will own the data warehousing for Workstream, with support from core product engineering / CTO. You'll serve as a thought partner to the the founders and work with engineering to make architectural & tooling decisions on how data will be stored and accessed, designing the system for maximum long term scalability, robustness, and actionability. In the future, this may include evaluating database providers, tools like dbt & Alteryx, and more.




- You will own the data modeling for our go-to-market (sales, marketing, customer success) and operations (revenue operations, finance) teams - creating clean schemas, intermediary data tables, aggregated analytics, and documentation so other teammates (analysts, ops, marketing, etc.) that are less tech savvy can write simple SELECT * queries to get the data they need to do their work.




- You will be responsible for creating and maintaining company KPI dashboards so everyone across the company can monitor our performance (we are transparent and data-driven), and team leads can make informed decisions.

You will succeed if you have a startup mentality of “getting sh*t done”, and you will grow as the company scales. If you are looking for a relaxed 9-5, please back away slowly. If you are insanely bright, hard working, humble, and looking to build a career on the ground floor of an exciting and fast-growing software-as-a-service (SaaS) business, this is for you.

An opportunity to be an early employee at a high-growth SaaS company and work directly with the founding team;
Full-time employees are offered comprehensive medical benefits;
A globally-distributed team who deeply cares about each other and shares ideas;
A belief that productivity is measured by output and not facetime;

We are rethinking our approach to data, using a modern data stack to improve both flexibility and governance of our data products.

Then, assist software engineers and analysts to create data products.

Benefits and perks

Our office is in iAccelerate on the Innovation Campus of University of Wollongong. Modern building with great facilities and a start-up vibe.

Skills and experience

To succeed in this role you will need:




a talent for organising information and processes,

Position Summary

Loftus Labs is looking for an ambitious data engineer and programmer to help our company meet the extract, transform, load (ETL) and other infrastructure needs of our client companies. The role is responsible for building and maintaining client data structures to support business intelligence and analytic use-cases. 




The Company 

Established in November of 2020, Loftus Labs is an analytics consulting start-up specializing in agribusiness companies in Central Washington. As our company expands beyond its current food and agriculture focus, we will always aspire to have a positive impact on farm and food economics. Our goal is to help small to medium size companies use their data in an effective way to increase their in-house data capabilities.




We are passionate about:

Equal opportunity employment.
Creating a safe, fair working environment.
Honest problem diagnosis and solving for our clients.
Delivering high-quality analytics products to our clients.
Data. It’s just cool to apply engineering and analytic methods to completely novel datasets. (How would you like to help us automate a demand forecast for tree fruit?)




You

Are intellectually curious. We often deal with source data systems that have no pre-existing ETL solutions.
Enjoy solving engineering problems with code.
Are interested in solving client business problems with data. 
Relish working autonomously to develop unique solutions to provision data.
Are excited at the prospect of setting up a beachhead in industries that have not traditionally realized the value of their data.
Want to learn and grow with a new company for the long-term.

 

The Role

Working closely with:

Clients to understand their data constraints and requirements.

Data science and analytics colleagues to build supportive infrastructure.

Conceptualizing and coding new infrastructure that allows data to be accessed and analyzed. Some recent examples include: 

Azure Function development to connect blob storage to a Snowflake warehouse. 

Migration of an agronomy operations database from an Access / SQL data environment to cloud data warehouse.

Reformulating existing data architectures to optimize data quality. 
Coding diagnostic and test structures to ensure that we spot small data problems before they become serious.
Preparing raw data for manipulation by data analysts and scientists.
Ensuring proper data quality and ongoing ETL functionality.
Documenting all engineering work and formulating new engineering best-practices and processes.
Remaining up to date with industry standards and technological advancements that will improve the quality of our work.
Developing your own skills and interests, e.g. business intelligence, data and decision science. 

 

Skills and Qualifications

4+ years of experience as a data engineer, data programmer or similar.
Expert proficiency in SQL, and 1 or more of the following in a business context: Python, C#, Java. If Python isn’t your language that’s not a problem, but you should be prepared to learn it in order to work with our analytics team.
Expertise working with various endpoints for data extraction (API, ODBC, etc).
Working knowledge of cloud computing platforms (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud).
Familiarity with SQL Server and/or Snowflake (or suitable equivalent) and one or more ETL technologies (Fivetran, dbt, Azure Data Factory, Talend, etc.).
Strong problem-solving skills.
Scrupulous approach to data quality.
Capacity to successfully manage a pipeline of duties with minimal supervision.
Some experience connecting data to, and using, visualization and analytic tools like Tableau, Power BI is advantageous.

 

Education

As long as you have data engineering experience and an interest in business analytics, we don’t care if you studied medieval history or secretly proved the Riemann Hypothesis.
A Master's degree in a relevant field is advantageous but not critical."

About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

2612098678,"Hoe maak jij onze klanten blij?

Bol.com verandert retail om het dagelijks leven makkelijker te maken. Die missie gaan we niet solo aan, maar met meer dan 39.000 zakelijke partners die op ons retail tech platform ondernemen. Samen gaan we voor maximale klantwaarde. Daarbij is het cruciaal dat we de juiste strategische koers uitzetten, want we pionieren volop. Kun jij datagoud van pyriet onderscheiden? En inzichten omzetten in adviezen die collega’s tot actie inspireren?

De grootste uitdaging

We willen ons retail tech platform data-gedreven besturen. Meetbaar maken wat er gebeurt. Voorspellen hoe de toekomst eruit gaat zien. En op basis daarvan verbeteringen en innovaties initiëren. Klinkt logisch, maar ons platform is ‘werk in uitvoering’ en we vinden het wiel rijdend uit. Dat betekent dat je niet alleen een kei moet zijn in technische analyses, maar ook in staat dient te zijn om draagvlak te creëren voor je ideeën. Uitdagend, want je werkt in een snel veranderende omgeving waarin ideeën om voorrang vechten…

Wat je doet als Platform Analist

Je adviseert op operationele en strategische platformvraagstukken met geavanceerde data-analyses op maat
Je ontwikkelt, monitort en bewaakt de KPI’s van het platform
Je analyseert de platformperformance en formuleert hypotheses ter verbetering
Je voert (statistische) experimenten & simulaties uit om hypotheses te toetsen aan data
Je geeft, samen met het team, vorm aan een state-of-the-art analytics omgeving in de Google Cloud (o.a. Git, CI/CD, BigQuery, SQL, Python, Airflow, dbt, Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau, Datastudio)



Die Topics Zijn Grofweg Onder Te Verdelen In Drie Domeinen

Als Platform Analist lever je een meetbare bijdrage aan een grote verscheidenheid aan projecten, want alle platform topics zijn in beeld.

E-commerce platform – hoe borgen we dat klanten de producten vinden die ze zoeken en kwalitatief hoogwaardige partners deze producten aanbieden tegen competitieve voorwaarden?
Logistiek platform – hoe helpen we partners, gegeven de eindige logistieke capaciteit, de beste verzendservice te kiezen?
Proposities voor onze partners – hoe maken we het partners zo aantrekkelijk en makkelijk mogelijk om op ons platform te ondernemen?


Je werkt bijvoorbeeld aan een segmentatiemodel, assortimentsanalyses, simulaties van ons koopblok algoritme en het commissiemodel, manieren om prijzen op ons platform te verbeteren of je analyseert de impact van onze nieuwe verzendproposities op de kwaliteit van het aanbod.

Aan jou om deze vraagstukken (en meer!) te doorgronden, afwegingen inzichtelijk te maken en aan te tonen wat het effect van beleidskeuzes op platformprocessen is. Je vertaalt inzichten naar overtuigende adviezen en gebruiksvriendelijke tools die een directe bijdrage leveren aan de platform business. Daarbij ben je in staat om het perspectief van partners, klanten én ons platform te vertegenwoordigen en te verenigen. Als Platform Analist trek je op met propositie- en platformteams, die je inspireert om besluiten op basis van, soms onvolledige, maar altijd objectieve inzichten te nemen.

Waarom jij het verschil kunt maken

Omdat je graag laat zien wat je met jouw analytische gereedschapskist en petabytes aan interessante data kunt doen. Je combineert technische vaardigheden met het vermogen om ‘abstracte’ inzichten te vertalen naar concrete verbetervoorstellen. We zoeken een collega die open staat voor alles wat de advanced analytics wereld te bieden heeft en die er niet voor terugdeinst om op ‘vallen, opstaan en weer doorgaan’ basis te werken. Je bent een team player, staat open voor feedback, hebt passie voor technologie en bent razend nieuwsgierig.

3 redenen waarom dit (n)iets voor jou is

Wel, als je 2+ jaar werkervaring hebt op het gebied van big data, software development, business intelligence en/of data science (skills zijn belangrijker dan diploma’s boven je bed)
Wel, als je met SQL en Python complexe data in toepasbare inzichten kunt omtoveren
Wel, als je de meerwaarde van je ideeën graag aantoont met behulp van simulaties en experimenten
Niet, als je analyses als eindproduct beschouwt en ze graag over de schutting gooit zonder te zorgen dat de uitkomsten worden toegepast
Niet, als je graag alles zelf wilt doen, niets los kan laten en samenwerking schuwt
Niet, als je het lastig vindt om een mening te vormen en uit te dragen"

A Little Bit About Us…

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS’ foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS’ Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS’ Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world."

About Dandy And Dandy Data

Dandy is a business-in-a-box for dentists. Our vision is to become the operating system for every dental office in America by leading the transition to digital dentistry for the $200 billion industry. You can see our current offerings here (note that the list is expanding quickly!). Headquartered in New York City, Dandy is backed by the world's leading venture capital investors.

Data Analytics and Data Science are a fundamental part of Dandy's core offerings and are key pillars for its success. Dandy is constantly adding new product offerings or taking over more pieces of our (very complex) production chain, and we suspect that there will be plenty of very interesting fundamental data problems for a very long time.

Dandy's data program is newly led by a team with a proven track record of building data practices at hypergrowth companies. We are all aligned on the mission of propelling the company to market dominance. Simultaneously, we also believe that promoting individual growth is part and parcel of this mission and the best way to achieve success. Whether you want to grow technically (self-directed training days every quarter, technical discussions at dandy run from analytics tools through to ML for point-cloud image segmentation) or organizationally (all work is highly cross functional, we want you to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible, opportunities for management exist as well if that interests you) we think Dandy is the place for you.

A Little Bit About Us…

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS’ foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS’ Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch.

👋 In case we haven’t met before, here’s Supermetrics in a nutshell:

We’re a diverse bunch of people with shared values. Above all else, we’re kind, humble, open, and dedicated to building things our customers love. 
We build marketing data connectors that help over half a million people get data. Literally.
Our more well-known customers include L’Oreal, Disney, the BBC, Dyson, and WarnerBros (but we also serve thousands of agencies and smaller companies).

We're looking for a skilled Senior Data Analyst to join our BI team in our Helsinki HQ. You’ll work with many different departments (such as sales, support, customer success, design) and build end-to-end reporting solutions starting from data validation, ETL in BigQuery, data modelling with dbt, building visualizations and reports in Looker, and answering business questions of the end-user. Moreover, you will perform in-depth analyses on a per-need basis and effectively communicate your analysis to business users. We’re looking for someone who can help build and improve our internal reporting and analytics processes, facilitate user onboarding and training, enable a self-serve analysis of the business users and drive a reliable data culture.

Senior-level experience with a BI tool such as Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, or Qlik, good knowledge of data modeling principles
+5 years hands-on experience with reporting, business intelligence, and analytics implementing BI projects 
Excellent SQL knowledge and experience in working with data warehouses such as BigQuery
Analytical mindset and data visualization skills
Excellent communication skills in English




Prior work experience in a Saas Business or marketing analytics environment is a plus, as well as experience with dbt, and we’ll be jumping for joy if you have some hands-on experience in programming and statistical languages such as R or Python. 




🥳 What’s in it for you?

At Supermetrics, you have the chance to grow your skills and career in one of the fastest-growing tech companies in Finland, with a solid track record of doubling our revenue YoY. 
As a Data Analyst, you’ll get to work with multiple teams and business functions using advanced and modern tools, such as Google Cloud Platform, dbt, and Looker. 
You will have a key role in enabling strategic decision-making based on data, optimizing and automating important business processes, and bringing in your best data modeling practices. 
You’ll take part in scaling our internal analytics environment - we encourage you to constantly learn and grow, accomplish amazing things and make a difference. 🤩




The reason people love to work at Supermetrics is all of us working towards the same goal with our own individual strengths. We’re determined to achieve our vision of being the best business data pipeline company in the world. At Supermetrics, we have a warm atmosphere and very talented people to learn from. We take our work seriously but place a lot of value on having fun together as well. We recognize our team as our greatest asset and take good care of our people. ❤️




Sounds like your kind of a place and challenge? Great! We can't wait to learn more about you. 😊

Accompagner les Data Analysts afin d’améliorer la structuration des données, répondre à leurs besoins, et leur donner les clés d’une modélisation maîtrisée.
Travailler avec l’équipe devOps afin de structurer et mesurer la performance de la stack.







Profil recherché:




Tu es notre profil idéal si :

Tu maîtrises parfaitement Python et SQL (et tu sais vérifier/valider ton code)
Tu as une bonne connaissance en environnement Cloud (AWS, GCP)
Tu as un profil très technique et tu es capable de travailler avec des profils techniques (DevOps, lead full stack, …).
Tu sais communiquer sur l’avancement de ton travail et évangéliser ton métier auprès d’une audience non technique.
Tu es curieux, débrouillard et tu as une démarche proactive.




En lien avec les missions actuelles, les connaissances suivantes sont un plus :

Modélisation de données (Kimball)
Outils d’ingestion (Fivetran, Airbytes, Stitch), et/ou de reserved-ETL.

A Little Bit About Us…

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS’ foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS’ Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS’ Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world."

Your opportunity

With Mollie’s continued rapid growth comes an ever-increasing need to make decisions based on data. Sitting in the BI & Analytics team, you will partner with stakeholders from across the business to understand how data can help serve their needs. Based on this, you will help model masses of complex, constantly evolving payment data into a shape that allows us to objectively measure performance.

With this role comes great responsibility, but don’t worry - you are not on your own. You will be working with Mollie’s wider Data Team, alongside some of the brightest Data Scientists and Data Engineers out there. On top of this, you will have a selection of the latest and greatest tools at your disposal (BigQuery, dbt, Looker). Are you up for the challenge?

What You'll Be Doing

Future-proofing - contribute to the design and execution of key initiatives across BI & Analytics required to help support Mollie’s rapid growth: data warehouse architecture, data governance, tooling, testing and documentation.
Metric definition - partner with fellow analysts and business stakeholders from different departments to help shape how we measure performance, taking care to ensure that everyone is on the same page.
Product analytics - manage the data models that feed analytical use cases including Looker, our BI tool. This means working closely with software engineers and domain experts to understand the complex schemas produced by Mollie’s digital assets and third party tools.
Data modeling - help manage the various Looker data models which enable business users to answer their own questions. You will need to work closely with business stakeholders to understand their most burning questions.
Financial control - support Financial audit activities through creating robust, automated, flexible financial reporting tools to aid reconciliation of Mollie bank accounts.
Ad-hoc analyses - undertake ad-hoc deep dive analyses to support the decision making process around exciting new initiatives like international expansion, new product launches and the development of new plugins + integrations.
Data-driven culture - help foster Mollie’s strong data-driven culture through coaching teams, presenting your work regularly and contributing to knowledge sharing sessions and Mollie’s internal blog.




What you have

You are an analytical thinker with strong attention to detail
You are able to synthesize data into a clear story
You are curious and always willing to learn new skills
You are proactive and have a ‘can do’ attitude
You are comfortable working in a fun, fast-paced environment
3 - 5 years experience as a Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer or BI Engineer
Strong SQL skills
Experience with a BI tool (preference towards Looker)
Experience working in a Cloud Environment e.g. Google Cloud or AWS
Experience working with Github / Gitlab
University degree in technical subject (Maths, Science, Engineering etc.)
Fluency in English

Nice to haves

Experience with a scripting language e.g. Python
Experience in Fintech or online payments




Our Selection procedure in a nutshell

Apply by clicking the button below. The more you share about yourself and the reason you apply at Mollie, the better!
To start with, our recruiter will contact you to find out more about you.
Then you will have an introductory talk with the hiring manager focused on the team fit and your general knowledge. This round will be conducted via Hangouts. If this round is successful you will have another interview with the hiring manager and a member of the data team to dive deeper into your experience.
After that you will receive a take-home assignment which you will present to us on Google Hangouts in the third round.
In the third round you will meet the rest of the data team and they will challenge you on your approach.

Because of the current circumstances, we will interview you as well as hire you completely remotely. You will start working remotely, but as soon as possible, you will continue your work at our office in the heart of Amsterdam.

﻿

Being authentic is our baseline

Mollie is one of Europe’s fastest-growing fintech companies. We provide a simple and clear payment API, which enables webshop and app builders to implement more than ten different payment methods in one go.

In the first few years of existence, Mollie was a developer-only adventure, and about 15 years later devs and techs still comprise roughly 45% of all staff. As a natural consequence, Mollie still is—and aims to be—highly tech-minded.

This focus on the technical side can be found in various things. Like, you pick whatever tools you want to use to get the job done. MacBooks, absurdly large or many screens, top-notch noise-cancelling headphones and whatever other equipment makes your nerd-boat float. We go to great lengths to create a space that allows you to focus on the things that will make you happy: shipping great features you helped dream up and build.

We don’t have code monkeys, but we do give you a problem and trust that you will create an outstanding solution. We believe in sane working hours and long-term solutions, instead of 70-hour work weeks with temporary workarounds."

About the Role:




Responsibilities




- You will be responsible for building, restructuring, & monitoring/ maintaining ELT pipelines between our GTM tools used within the company.

An opportunity to be an early employee at a high-growth SaaS company and work directly with the founding team;

2625163790,"If you want to combine modern data analytics, deep customer focus and the opportunity to change the world of pet food for good, this is it.

Changing the world of pet food for good

We’re tails.com, a dog food subscription company with a big difference. We create truly tailored food for each and every dog we serve. We start by asking people a few simple questions about their dog. Then we use that information to create their dog’s unique tails.com recipe – so their dog gets exactly the nutrition they need, in the taste they love, delivered to their door every month. It’s clever stuff.

We’ve got ambitious plans. Having created an entirely new category in pet food, we’re now scaling fast in the UK and Europe – backed by Purina, one of the world’s largest pet food companies. You’ll join a bunch of smart people working towards the same goals – and a bunch of smart-ish dogs, all working on their own thing.

Together, we’ll change the world of pet food for good.

Unmined insights are there, and we’re hungry for it

Our subscription model means we can trace a dog feeding tails.com through their full journey with us, from how and when they found out about us right through to what they (or their human) has done on our website and what products they order from us and what their blend was in their 27th box and beyond. This is a treasure trove of raw data, and it’s growing at breakneck speed as the number of dogs feeding our food doubles every year. Data alone isn’t going to help us change the world of pet food for good though, we need insight.

That’s where you come in.

Sound like a team you want to join? Here’s how you’ll make a difference:

The role

This role is a permanent full time position in our data team, working closely with a Product Manager and our loyalty teams to develop a deep understanding of our customers and how they use our service to improve their experience of tails.com.

The things you’ll do

Working closely with product engineering and loyalty teams, use data to build a deep understanding of how customers value and use our service, products and site
Use those insights to help these teams identify new areas for opportunities, define key product metrics, design tests to improve those metrics, and track KPIs
Define the data required that our products need to collect to better inform future insights and maintain the quality and integrity of our data over the long term.
Alongside the wider insights team, use your strong SQL skills to help maintain a robust data stack for whole company
Support the CRM team to understand their impact on retention and revenue metrics, run tests & identify areas of opportunity to drive additional value

The Skills You’ll Bring

Experience working in a data or product analytics role, closely tied to a product engineering team running experiments at pace

About Us

dbt Labs was founded in 2016 to empower analysts to create and disseminate organizational knowledge. Since then, we’ve grown to become one of the most respected brands in the analytics industry. Our product, dbt, is used by thousands of companies.

Who we are

At dbt Labs, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics.

Specifically, We Believe That

> Code, rather than graphical user interfaces, is the best tool for defining complex analytical logic.
> Data analysts and analytics engineers should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers: version control, testing, multiple environments, and continuous integration.
> Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open-source software.
> Analytic code itself — not just analytics tools — will increasingly be open source.

It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Over the course of the past several years we've built a community of 15,000+ people and 5,000 companies who are using our ideas, products, and workflows to conduct analytics, including Lyft, Monzo, GitLab, Snowflake, the ACLU, Amazon, JetBlue, and RentTheRunway.

Chief Technology Officer at RXNT

Send InMail

At RXNT, we think of ourselves as a backbone to the US healthcare system. Every day, we provide the digital foundation on which healthcare professionals serve patients, order medications and lab tests, bill insurance companies, and interact with the wider healthcare community. 




22 years of blood, sweat, and tears have taught us that this pursuit comes with great responsibility. It’s in the best interest of everyone if we hold ourselves to high standards, think rigorously, and at times, act urgently. 




As a member of RXNT’s Practice Management team, you’ll work at the convoluted intersection where patients, providers, insurance companies, and medical billers meet to charge, transact, and settle disputes. The complexity of this space and shortcomings of old technology have led RXNT to emerge as a disruptor; we take pride in creating a seamless experience for users and pay attention to the vast potential for optimization.  




We’re looking for self-motivated people who love to learn, are comfortable in a fast-paced and quickly-growing environment, and who seek ownership.




What you’ll be doing

As a Senior Analytics Engineer, you will design and implement data modeling, reporting, and queries for RXNT’s medical billing solution.
You will manage and extend RXNT’s customer-facing data warehouse models (BigQuery, DBT), write complex user-facing analytical queries, write and refactor transactional SQL Server queries, write SQL unit tests, improve data cleanliness, think in terms of data governance, and influence refactoring of SQL and noSQL tables/documents.
You will push for and maintain best practices, such as testing in DBT, performant SQL, and consistent code standards (e.g. Fishtown style guide).
You will communicate thoroughly with the product team, designers, engineers, and sometimes customers to understand user needs and nuances in RXNT’s data.
With the help of your engineering manager, you will often provide both optimistic and pessimistic time estimates for your work.
To a lesser degree, you will leverage data visualization tools like Data Studio or Tableau to help the team better understand customer data.




You might be a good fit if you

Have 4+ years experience as a data analyst, data engineer, or analytics engineer at an e-commerce or SaaS company
Consider yourself a “full stack data analyst”
Can communicate clearly and directly about complex technical topics
Have experience with DBT (ideally 1+ year)
Are proficient in writing analytical SQL and understand the difference between SQL that works, and performant SQL
Consider yourself a full stack data analyst
Have experience using the command line and git
Have a solid understanding of data warehouses and business intelligence tools
Are highly motivated to work autonomously, with strong organizational and time management skills"

About Us




At dbt Labs, our mission is to empower analysts to create and disseminate organizational knowledge.

We're looking for a software engineer to build cloud applications that make using dbt even more delightful and powerful.




Who we are

At dbt Labs, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics.




Specifically, we believe that:




- Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic

- Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers

- Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software

- Analytic code itself — not just analytics tools — will increasingly be open source




It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Over the course of the past several years we've built a community of 15,000+ people and 5,000 companies who are using our ideas, products, and workflows to conduct analytics, including Lyft, Monzo, GitLab, Snowflake, the ACLU, Amazon, JetBlue, and RentTheRunway. Our product, dbt, has come to be synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry. We’re backed by top investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, recently raising our series C: read the announcement!

Insurance... sounds slow, old-fashioned, and unexciting. Exactly. Insurance is broken, and it's failing fast-moving, innovative startups.

Vouch is a new, technology-first insurance company, backed with $100M in funding from world-class investors. Like Stripe for payments or Brex for credit cards, Vouch is creating the go-to business insurance for high growth companies.

We're doing this by making insurance fast, responsive, and focused on our customer -high growth and innovative companies. Instead of printed PDF applications and week-long waits, Vouch is building new technology to solve real problems, writing policies that actually cover relevant startup scenarios, and designing simple experiences in an otherwise frustrating industry.

The Job

Would you like to play a critical role in the success of the next wave of world-changing startups? Are you excited about understanding the pace and evolution of the venture ecosystem?

Join our team and take part in (1) assembling the most comprehensive startup dataset in the world, (2) building robust self-serve tooling to answer questions that drive our business, and (3) shape fundamental aspects of our nascent data-driven culture.

You Will Be Responsible For

Designing, building, and maintaining the data pipelines that feed our data warehouse from internal services, such as our insurance policy administration tools, underwriting models, or our CRM and marketing applications, as well as from third party systems.
Working with our sales, marketing, product, and insurance teams to identify and integrate datasets from a variety of sources in our core knowledge graph to represent entities in the venture ecosystem, and to better understand startups' insurable risks.
Collaborating with engineering teams to build cloud-native integrations, frameworks, and applications to join data across operational systems and data repositories to drive business decisions.
Specifying and instrumenting new logging events to produce insights into our customers' experience using our products.
Establishing best practices to ensure scalable data processing solutions, as well as researching and implementing efficient mechanisms for data access.

About You

Surprise us! Many applicants will have an MS or BS in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics, or a related field OR equivalent practical experience in data engineering
3+ years experience as a software engineer with focus on data infrastructure, distributed computing, or delivering data services
You can effectively talk (and listen) to engineers, designers, marketers, executives, and other stakeholders.
Experience with Python; deep familiarity with the Python standard library and commonly-used patterns for RDBMS integration and delivering RESTful APIs
Knowledgeable about software development best practices with a focus on testing, reliability and maintainability
Experience with data modeling and SQL, including solid knowledge of various datastores and their tradeoffs (RDBMS’s, NoSQL, etc)

At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

We're looking for an analyst to help build the dashboard and analysis framework for a major customer engagement program. Throughout this project, you will:

Lead QA on existing data infrastructure within and around Salesforce Marketing Cloud
Build upon an existing business intelligence dashboard
Respond to analytical requests from internal and client teams


The team

The Analytics team is the backbone of our agency—supporting efforts that span web development, email, social media, design, and paid media.

You bring 2-4 years of experience in Salesforce Marketing Cloud with Journey Builder and Automation Studio. You know how to set up query, data extract, and file transfer activities. Experience in additional Studios is a bonus.
You have intermediate to advanced experience with SQL (DBT experience preferred), cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Platform preferred), and data visualization through BI software (Google Data Studio preferred)

You can take a step back to see the bigger implications of your analysis work describe those insights to both your teammates and clients.
You're a thoughtful, organized teammate who isn't afraid to adapt to new situations, solve problems on the fly, and communicate readily with those around you.


At Blue State, diversity is a necessity, not a nice-to-have. We encourage those from underrepresented communities — women, people of color, LGBTQIA+, immigrants, indigenous folks, those with disabilities and people at all the intersections in between — to apply. Even if you don't think your current skill set checks every box below, but this role seems to align with your strengths, we want to hear from you.

Blue State is a purpose-driven agency. We partner with leading causes, brands, and campaigns and create real change. From Google and UNICEF to AARP and Planned Parenthood, we transform how brands and causes raise money, influence policy, build platforms, and grow communities of supporters."

2616453458,"At Keap, we help small businesses succeed - and small businesses need timely and accurate data. That’s why we’re looking for a talented Data Engineer to work with us on solving interesting problems, in a fun environment, using advanced technologies.

Our Team

Our team is made up of experienced software and data engineers who solve the data needs of our organization. We work closely with both product engineers and data analysts, transforming broad goals into specific data requirements that we then deliver. We also work with engineers to develop solutions and answer questions regarding data. The expectations are high, but so is the support from management - promoting data integrity is a key mandate for the organization.

Our Work

Much of the Data Team’s work until now has been extraction of core data for internal consumption. With the launch of Keap Analytics, we are now supplying data for customer consumption as well. In addition, our product organization’s gradual decomposition of our core application into microservices provides us with new challenges and opportunities in storing and migrating data.

Our team has just lost its last remaining engineer from a previous era and we are determined to rewrite old code. Much of it is in Python, but core pieces are in Scala and Java and we would like to replace these with components we understand.

We are heavily invested in Google’s cloud infrastructure but are in the process of shifting our data warehouse to Snowflake. Listed below is our stack. Experience in the following specific technologies is not required - we are looking for people who enjoy learning!

Snowflake
Google Cloud (Bigquery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Composer, PubSub, Kubernetes)
DBT
Python (current)
Java/Scala (deprecating)
CircleCI
Terraform/Snowchange


Your Work

Help integrate Snowflake into customer and internal analytic products
Develop new product data ETLs to meet the needs of customer and internal analytic products
Rewrite in Python core extractions currently written in Java and Scala, bringing our platform to one consistent language
Work with feature teams to establish data warehouse processes for streaming and reading data, especially as they decompose into event-based microservices
Explore new data technologies and advise teams on best practices


Preferred Education and Experience:

Advanced programming ability
Understanding and application of modern data processing technology stacks, such as Spark, Hadoop ecosystem technologies, DataFlow, and others
Understanding of event-based architectures and streaming data technologies
Experience building ETL/ELT pipelines, familiar with Airflow
Understanding of data warehousing in a cloud environment


Ideally, you also possess…

Ability to program in Python and Java (with a bonus for PySpark experience)
Experience with Google BigQuery or Snowflake
Experience with agile development methods



About Keap

In 2001, Keap (formerly Infusionsoft) pioneered the sales and marketing automation category for small business. Today, Keap is the #1 CRM platform in its category. We're 400+ strong and seeking talented and intelligent people to help us on our mission of helping grow small businesses worldwide.

This position is located at our Chandler, AZ office at 1260 South Spectrum Blvd. Chandler AZ 85286

At Keap, we celebrate diversity and inclusion for the benefit of our employees, our products, our community, and to help small businesses succeed. We do not discriminate based on race, color, ethnicity, ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, veteran status, marital status or any legally protected status."

Description

At RXNT, we think of ourselves as a backbone to the US healthcare system. Every day, we provide the digital foundation on which healthcare professionals serve patients, order medications and lab tests, bill insurance companies, and interact with the wider healthcare community.

22 years of blood, sweat, and tears have taught us that this pursuit comes with great responsibility. It’s in the best interest of everyone if we hold ourselves to high standards, think rigorously, and at times, act urgently.

As a member of RXNT’s Practice Management team, you’ll work at the convoluted intersection where patients, providers, insurance companies, and medical billers meet to charge, transact, and settle disputes. The complexity of this space and shortcomings of old technology have led RXNT to emerge as a disruptor; we take pride in creating a seamless experience for users and pay attention to the vast potential for optimization.

We’re looking for self-motivated people who love to learn, are comfortable in a fast-paced and quickly-growing environment, and who seek ownership.

What you'll be doing

As an Analytics Engineer, you will design and implement data modeling, reporting, and queries for RXNT’s medical billing solution.
You will manage and extend RXNT’s customer-facing data warehouse models (BigQuery, DBT), write complex user-facing analytical queries, write and refactor transactional SQL Server queries, write SQL unit tests, improve data cleanliness, think in terms of data governance, and influence refactoring of SQL and noSQL tables/documents.
You will push for and maintain best practices, such as testing in DBT, performant SQL, and consistent code standards (e.g. Fishtown style guide).
You will communicate thoroughly with the product team, designers, engineers, and sometimes customers to understand user needs and nuances in RXNT’s data.
With the help of your engineering manager, you will often provide both optimistic and pessimistic time estimates for your work.
To a lesser degree, you will leverage data visualization tools like Data Studio or Tableau to help the team better understand customer data.

You might be a good fit if you

Have a proven track record (3+ years of experience) as a data analyst at a SaaS company
Are proficient in writing analytical SQL and understand the difference between SQL that works, and performant SQL
Consider yourself a full-stack data analyst
Have experience using the command line and git
Have a solid understanding of data warehouses and business intelligence tools
Have experience with DBT
Can communicate clearly and directly about complex technical topics
Are highly motivated to work autonomously, with strong organizational and time management skills"

2623575846,"The Company

An incredibly exciting performance data analytics platform company. They identify what data can make the biggest impact for a company, transform it quickly and cost-effectively from a wide range of sources and ultimately make it clear, reliable and easy to manage.

They are always reaching for the latest approaches, tools and technology to enable themselves to move fast and deliver more value. As well as being an extremely intelligent group, this is a really sociable company – both inside of work, through knowledge sharing sessions and outside of work.

The Role

As this is a small, yet expanding data science team, they are still defining how they work and how their platform should function, which means there’s plenty of new ground to explore!

As a member of the data science team you will:

Develop use-cases directly with their customers and steer their implementations to drive at the most valuable outcomes.
Shape their data science culture and how they work. They would like to learn from your experience.
Keep up-to-date with the latest developments in research, applications, and technologies.
Teach and learn from other members of the team.
Make material contributions to automation capabilities of our in-built Decision Engine platform.

The data science infrastructure is based in AWS and integrated with Sagemaker. Pipelines are built with Python, SQL (via DBT), Pyspark, and productionised in Docker. Models are built in multiple frameworks (ScikitLearn, XGBoost, Pytorch, and Tensorflow) – you will pick the best tool for the job. The team

works across the whole lifecycle of model development, from exploration and prototyping in Notebooks through to deployment and maintenance in their Decision Engine platform.

The Individual

This organisation is looking for experienced data scientists to build up the core team, as they need to

At Monzo, we’re growing extremely fast and have over four and half million customers in the UK, with over 100,000 new people joining every month. You'll have the opportunity to help us ensure the quality of the work done in Financial Crime in 2021 and help us continue to build a bank safely, and in control.

This role will be supporting the Assurance team, and will focus on making sure we can measure and understand the performance of staff members working on key operational projects within Financial Crime. You’ll be responsible for working with our FinCrime Assurance Lead to ensure we check the right number and type of tasks to have confidence in our metrics, that our scoring is robust and fair, and that any root causes of poor performance are identified. You’ll also be responsible for providing key stakeholders across the business with self-service dashboards for real time understanding of the metrics you have created.

We work in cross-functional squads where every data analyst is a member of a central Data Discipline but will be fully embedded into one area (for this role, it will be embedded within the Quality Assurance team, who monitor the quality of the work our Customer Operations team does, with a specific focus on Financial Crime Quality Assurance).
Data at Monzo
Our Data team's mission is to Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

At the core of this mission sits our data platform. We're great believers in powerful, real-time analytics and empowerment of the wider business. Every engineer at Monzo is responsible for collection of relevant analytics events from their microservices. We optimise for simplicity and re-usability – all our data lives in one place and is made available via our data warehouse in Google BigQuery. 90% of day-to-day data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.
Our technology stack

We Rely Heavily On The Following Tools And Technologies (note We Do Not Expect Applicants To Have Prior Experience Of All Them)

Google Cloud Platform for all of our analytics infrastructure
dbt and BigQuery SQL for our data modelling and warehousing
Python for data science
Go to write our application code
AWS for most of our backend infrastructure
As part of your role, you'll:

Build robust data models, reports and visualisations (mostly in BigQuery SQL) that support the Quality Assurance team in ensuring they’re checking the right tasks at the right time, and that the information they collect is easy to understand and use
Collect, analyse, and disseminate information and analysis on the results of our quality assurance processes.
Develop, maintain, and modify strategies for quality assurance and accreditation of our Customer Operations staff. You’ll start with a focus on work done in Financial Crime, but with a view to building sustainable solutions that can be used across Operations at Monzo.
Identify information and data gaps, create techniques and collation processes to close such gaps
Support the business with analytical deep dives to identify root causes of issues uncovered by quality assurance checks
Provide key stakeholders across the business with self-service dashboards for real time understanding of the metrics you have created, using Looker
What's special about data at Monzo?
Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. All of our infrastructure is designed so that we can have really high data quality, and spend most of our time using that data to support business decisions.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there’s some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

You Should Apply If

What we’re doing here at Monzo excites you!
You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and very importantly your colleagues as well
You're passionate about data and using that data to improve & inform business decisions
You’re as comfortable getting hands-on as taking a step back and thinking strategically
You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
Nice to haves:

You have experience in data analytics, preferably in a fast moving tech company
You have experience of using a BI tool like Looker to provide dashboards and self-serve analysis tools to stakeholders
Logistics
We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.

We offer share options and competitive salaries based on skills and experience.

Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a take home task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions.

2617753401,"We are looking for resourceful data analysts to own some of our highest impact problems.

Dandy's Data program is racing to catch up to the rest of the company. Dandy has extraordinarily complex operational and technical challenges (and some very impressive people working to meet these challenges) - data is one of the central keys to its success. The opportunities for personal growth in this position are extremely high. You will be pushed to the edge of your comfort zone but strongly supported technically and organizationally by a kind, diverse, low ego, extremely intelligent, extremely effective team. Dandy is an extremely high growth startup - though the company is on a rocketship trajectory, it is still early enough to get started within the positive environment of a smaller organization.

Data analysts own everything from data stewardship through to strategy analysis, including: structuring the problem and key metrics, data capture design, analytic frameworks, product design analysis, data/analysis accessibility for business partners, deep-dive strategic analyses. Your role will be problem(s)-based, and will likely involve driving all of these components. Data analysts here become relatively independent technically - we say that our analysts are ""full stack"". We serve every department in the company.

About Dandy

Dandy is a business-in-a-box for dentists. Our vision is to become the operating system for every dental office in America by leading the transition to digital dentistry for the $200 billion industry. You can see our current offerings here (note that the list is expanding quickly!). Headquartered in New York City, Dandy is backed by the world's leading venture capital investors.

Data Analytics and Data Science are a fundamental part of Dandy's core offerings and are key pillars for its success. We are constantly adding new product offerings or taking over more pieces of our (very complex) supply chain, and we suspect that there will be plenty of very interesting fundamental data problems for a very long time.

About Dandy Data

Dandy's data program is newly led by a team with a proven track record of building data practices at hypergrowth companies. We are all aligned on the mission of propelling the company to market dominance. Simultaneously, we also believe that promoting individual growth is part and parcel of this mission and the best way to achieve success. Whether you want to grow technically (self-directed training days every quarter, technical discussions at dandy run from analytics tools through to ML for point-cloud image segmentation) or organizationally (all work is highly cross functional, we want you to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible, opportunities for management exist as well if that interests you) we think Dandy is the place for you. You will be strongly supported in pushing your comfort zone as far out as makes sense, and the opportunities for doing that here are much more numerous than most places. We also have some pretty cool custom Data infrastructure and tooling which we like to think makes every analyst on our team several times more effective than under a regular paradigm.

Responsibilities

Own every part of the data and strategy cycle for your problem(s) - data capture design, strategy and metrics development, analytics frameworks, accessible reporting, coaching of business stakeholders, deep dive analyses, etc

We bring together construction industry experts with top engineering, analytics, and data science talent to help rethink and redefine how construction plans, manages, and connects with data generated in the field. 

 

Our partner’s platform enables project teams to simplify field data capture and easily share critical performance details across their organization, giving real-time insights into production and safety conditions on the jobsite.

2622846192,"Zymergen is hiring a Senior Manager to lead our Automation Platform Software team in designing, developing, and deploying automation solutions to our labs. The breadth of responsibilities is great, covering biological, chemical, and material science labs; off-the-shelf solutions and novel integrated systems of our own design. The team is multidisciplinary, including 1 automation engineer and 6 software engineers covering an unusually broad “full stack” from hardware drivers to frontend web apps. The Senior Manager will report to the Head of Automation and work closely with other Automation managers as well as group leads and subject matter experts in other scientific and engineering departments.

Zymergen is building the technology for a scalable, reconfigurable, highly automated industrial microbe factory. Backed by automated chemical synthesis and properties testing, the microbial strains this factory creates will produce new chemicals with properties unlike anything that can be derived from petroleum.

About The Job

This is an exciting management position leading a highly engaged team creating software products for the lab using modern tools. Your team’s largest (but not only!) product, in flight for 3 years, is an advanced Automation Control Software for controlling robots and scientific instruments in Zymergen’s wet labs. Busy robots generate interesting data streams, and capturing and surfacing those is the second area of focus of the team. Maintenance of existing products rounds out the team’s responsibilities.

Most of the individual contributors on the team have the title “Software Engineer” and not “Automation Engineer” on purpose: Our tech stack combines a modern web tech stack with a few cherry-picked components you’d find in a traditional process control system. Our codebase currently contains REST APIs served by Django apps, Vue.js for user interfaces, Python’s asyncio in worker processes, a collection of device drivers (also written in Python), DBT-defined tables and views in Zymergen’s data lake, and dashboards in Grafana and Tableau. Our infrastructure includes Kubernetes, Puppet-managed EC2 instances, Kafka, MySQL, as well as a few Windows machines and PLCs.

As the head of a highly effective team, you will have the opportunity to shape Zymergen’s automation software architecture and direct the introduction of new technology within a growing company. Zymergen’s Automation Platform Software team has designed and developed the most advanced automation control software for the integration of biological lab automation in the industry. Your efforts will ensure this system reaches its full potential - namely, the automation of >80% of our biological lab work. In our chemistry and material science labs, there is more basic ground work to be laid as we automate in a space that has seen limited innovation to date. Zymergen is not just a synthetic biology company; it’s a products company. Many of the products we make have never been made before, and automation in chemistry and material science will accelerate our success.

You will spend most of your energy guiding the team: Understanding the broader context of your team’s work. Turning context into strategy by setting goals for the year and translating those goals into prioritized quarterly objectives. Helping leads and engineers on the team accomplish their tasks by listening, providing advice, and clearing blockers. Giving feedback, both directional and developmental. Communicating with the team so they know everything they need to do their job as well as everything that’s coming their way. Communicating with other teams so that they know what we’re doing and not doing and when.

Your management will keep the team running smoothly. Among other things, you will: Run team meetings. Have regular one-on-ones with your team members. Give strategic, tactical, and career guidance. Think about team structure and long term group needs. Track and shape the team’s skills inventory. Guide the hiring process for new engineers or managers. Establish and improve relationships and boundaries with other teams. Keep team members productive and happy. Work closely with managers and tech leads to define project scope and ensure access to necessary resources. Work with your reports to match projects with engineers. Contribute to yearly and quarterly project and CapEx planning for the department. Negotiate contracts with outside vendors. Think about patent strategy. Keep abreast of new technologies. Participate in due-diligence efforts. Work with Purchasing, Legal, Marketing, HR, and other groups to get things done and allow your team members focus on building the Zymergen automation platform.

About You

Note that this section describes a nearly ideal candidate. Hopefully it does so in a way that gives insight into what this job entails. Please don’t hesitate to apply even if you don’t feel like you’re a perfect match! Humility itself is a good sign....

You have several years of software management experience, ideally 4+. You have managed medium-sized teams, perhaps even managed managers. You have managed highly technical teams and projects. You might have a CS degree, or not.

You approach your job with humility. You listen to others and are always ready to have your mind changed. Moreover, you can think of several times in the recent past when your mind has been changed. You have a growth mindset, aware that both you and others will always have things to learn and ways to improve. You are both interested in the details and ready to trust that your team members know best. You enjoy working with people and helping them work through difficult situations, whether they be technical or interpersonal. You don’t get flustered easily, and you naturally look for ways to make progress despite hurdles or setbacks. You are up to the task of managing a team that is mixed on-site and remote. You are thoughtful about increasing diversity, in all its forms, in our field.

The perfect candidate has familiarity with laboratory automation. You know a Bravo from an Echo; VWorks from Cellario. Polymerization and doctor blade in addition to miniprep and NGS; chemical reactors in addition to bioreactors. Because this is very specialized knowledge, we only require that you’re interested in learning about new industries and new instruments and not that you know them already.

You aren’t necessarily an expert Python programmer or wizard with Vue.js, but you know enough about modern software development that you can provide meaningful guidance to professional software developers.

You are excited about being at the intersection of several fields. You enjoy leading a highly effective team. You are energized by the idea of making “impossible” materials with biology.

Additional Details

This job will frequently require working onsite in Emeryville, CA. In the short term (until ~September 1st), most work will be done remotely. After that, the expectation is that you will spend at least 2 days per week on site. Candidates must be willing to relocate to the Bay Area in the near future if they’re not there already. At least some of your work will involve (expensive!) machines which are located in our laboratories in Emeryville, CA. Emeryville is one of the biotech hubs in the Bay Area’s “tech industry” and easy to commute to: Zymergites bicycle or ride public transit from Berkeley and Oakland, take the train or company shuttle from the South Bay, and BART or drive from SF.

Previous experience in the field of synthetic biology is not essential.

Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required. Zymergen may agree to sponsor an individual for an employment visa now or in the future if there is a shortage of individuals with particular skills for this job.

In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification form upon hire.

Founded in 2013 and based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Zymergen is a technology company unlocking the power of biology. We deliver better economics for products made from biology that are used across industries, bring new products to market faster, and develop novel products. Our proprietary platform uses robots and machine learning to engineer microbes faster, more predictably, and to a level of performance previously unattainable. These microbes, and the products they produce, have broad applications across industries such as chemicals and materials, agriculture, and healthcare. For more information visit www.zymergen.com."

Being at the forefront of this revolution means that the Head of PS Digital Sciences should guide, be pioneering and influential. He/she must positively influence peers, department staff and leadership, allowing the organization to gain momentum with our digital transformation.

Translation & Storytelling

Even though technological innovation has the potential to drastically improve our business, success will come to those who focus their efforts on the right priorities. The Head of PS Digital Sciences should therefore be able to understand how to best leverage technology innovation to address our specific opportunities and challenges, and to tell that story in a meaningful and comprehensible manner at all levels of the organization, creating a strong level of engagement.

Execution

Execution requires not just deep technical knowledge and project management skills, but the ability to navigate and cut through resistance to change. He/she should minimize this resistance by engaging with the teams and using resistance busting methods like agile.

Understanding Technological Trends

The Head of PS Digital Sciences must have a deep understanding of technology and its potential futures, always remaining up-to-date on new trends. He/she should create awareness of potential opportunities/threats amongst the Pharma Sciences Leadership Team and promote digital alertness within the organization.

Year Up’s intensive training program utilizes a high expectations, high support model where students learn in-demand technical and professional skills and apply them during a corporate internship. Year Up has served more than 30,000 young adults since its founding in 2000. Year Up has a presence in 27 U.S. cities, including Arizona, Baltimore, Bay Area, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Greater Atlanta, Greater Boston, Greater Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, the National Capital Region, New York City/Jersey City, Pittsburgh, Puget Sound, Rhode Island, South Florida, Tampa Bay, and Wilmington.

Our staff is passionate, supportive, mission-driven, and committed to positive change and continuous learning.

About Us

dbt Labs, the creators and maintainers of dbt, was founded in 2016 to empower analysts to create and disseminate organizational knowledge. Since then, we’ve grown to become one of the most respected brands in the analytics industry, with adoption of dbt 3x-ing every year since founding. Our success is due in no small part to enormous change in the data space happening on a scale not seen in the last twenty years, as explained by one of our solutions architects in a recent blog.

It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Over the course of the past several years we've built a community of 15,000+ people and 5,000 companies who are using our ideas, products, and workflows to conduct analytics, including Lyft, Monzo, GitLab, Snowflake, the ACLU, Amazon, JetBlue, and RentTheRunway.

Sitting in IT, the Senior Analytics Engineer collaborates with and influences analysts and business users across the organization to produce analytical material that enables a more rigorous and empirical understanding of our operations and outcomes.

Business Intelligence sits at the intersection of business and technology, and this role is grounded in both.

Key Responsibilities

This will primarily be executed using database software, with a strong emphasis on SQL and data warehousing. Projects the Senior Analytics Engineer will work on include:

Extractions and feeds from other systems or services
Data modeling, processing and warehousing

Organization Description

Year Up is a national 501(c)3 wo rkforce development organization committed to ensuring equitable access to economic opportunity, education, and justice for all young adults—no matter their background, income, or zip code.

Year Up’s intensive training program utilizes a high expectations, high support model where students learn in-demand technical and professional skills and apply them during a corporate internship. Year Up has served more than 30,000 young adults since its founding in 2000. Year Up has a presence in 27 U.S. cities, including Arizona, Baltimore, Bay Area, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Greater Atlanta, Greater Boston, Greater Philadelphia, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, the National Capital Region, New York City/Jersey City, Pittsburgh, Puget Sound, Rhode Island, South Florida, Tampa Bay, and Wilmington.

Voted one of the Best Nonprofits to Work For in the country by The NonProfit Times, Year Up is a rewarding place to work.

We allow our customers to shop from any of our e-commerce partners and pick up their products in one of our conveniently located Instaboxes. We’re fast, both in terms of parcel delivery and when it comes to growing our business.

Within the Business Intelligence team, you will get the opportunity to shape how Instabox builds its data warehouse which services everyone in our organization and enables us to make better decisions.

Demonstrate an appetite to try new approaches, staying up to date with market trends and advances in data processing
Be comfortable promoting your great work both internally and externally

The main parts of this role are ensuring that we can model our raw data to support both KPIs and self-service analysis, but also be able to flip to non-routine tasks that could be supporting a new product or service and it’s viability.  The mindset of a data engineer combined with the curiosity of a data analyst is the intersection we feel is crucial.




We think you are a person who...

Will have a minimum of 3+ years’ experience in a Data Engineering or Data Scientist role
A university degree in an analytical field (e.g. Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics)
Has a strong knowledge of SQL and command of analytical functions
Understands data modeling techniques and their value in delivering end user self-service
Has good programming skills coupled with using source control

Is a passionate self-starter that enjoys taking the initiative to find solutions to obvious and hidden problems and has a deep interest in putting data to work




We offer you

The chance to be part of something truly amazing. The journey ahead is what excites every Instaboxer working here today and we are just getting started. Then there is the compensation package, benefits, centrally located office etc. but we’ll get to that in due time. 




If you’ve read this far there is clearly nothing stopping you from clicking the apply button.




We look forward to meeting you.

I really think you’re ready for something new! Come join my team and you will have the chance to work with a modern data stack and do things your way. And you get to help me build the most exciting and progressive data team in Stockholm




Niclas Roos, Head of Data




You will be a part of…

...an international environment with offices around Europe with our headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. You will join a fast and innovative environment and be part of an entrepreneurial and great-positioned company, growing at an exciting pace. Scrive is filled with caring, smart, and passionate people. We care about each other and always strive for the better, both for the company’s and the employee’s development. Our aim is that, a few years from now, you will be able to say; “We did that, I was a part of the Scrive Story.”  




This is a new role at Scrive and you will play an important role in building and shaping our Data team. You will be located at our office in Stockholm and report to our Head of Data, Niclas Roos. Our plan is that the team will consist of four persons by the end of the year.




Your challenge 

The first year of the data team has been a one-man show that was all about finding data, selecting tools, and starting to bring insights to the business. Now, the time has come to bring method to the madness and create a structure that enables collaboration, increased productivity, and improved quality. As the principal technical resource within the data team, you will help the team to work in a more structured way, using agile methods, version control etc. Your main points of contact will be the other members of the data team and system owners in various departments, as you work to make our data better, more accurate, and comprehensive.




In your everyday work, you will:

Be responsible for developing and maintaining our dbt models.
Work together with the team and other departments to explore and integrate new data sources, while also working to improve how we capture and structure data in our source systems to ensure data quality.
Support the rest of the team’s analytical work with advanced SQL queries and scripts, as well as independently perform and review different types of analyses.
Own the technical setup of Snowflake, Fivetran, and our python processing capabilities.
Work comfortably with all parts of the data stack: python, Snowflake, Tableau, and Excel.




Who you are

To succeed in the role as a Data Engineer we believe that you are comfortable with and excited about these things:

Writing and validating SQL queries that enables a deeper understanding and new ways of analyzing the business.
Building data transformations with dbt (or a profound willingness to learn).
Solving tricky problems, or at least avoiding mind numbingly dull tasks, with Python (or similar programming language).
Being your own devops, if needed, and having a knack for coming up with clever ways to resolve technical problems while still being conscious about security and privacy concerns.
Working with modern developer tools, such as GitHub, Jira etc.
Coming to a greenfield environment, you take responsibility for your own working methods and processes. You will need to take an active part in scoping, planning, and prioritizing your work.




Big bonus points if you:

Just can’t help yourself from visualizing data and have experience from Tableau or similar tools.
Are the kind of person that people often come to for help with Excel.
Love to find and test cool new tools, modules, and libraries.




In this role we see that you are flexible, structured, mature, responsible and problem solving. We’re using a competence-based recruitment process where those competences will play an important role.




Our selection process is continuous, and the advert may close before the recruitment process is completed if we have moved forward to the screening or interview phase."

Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers
Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software
Analytic code itself — not just analytics tools — will increasingly be open source

It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Over the course of the past several years we've built a community of 15,000+ people and 5,000 companies who are using our ideas, products, and workflows to conduct analytics, including Lyft, Monzo, GitLab, Snowflake, the ACLU, Amazon, JetBlue, and RentTheRunway. Our product, dbt, has come to be synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry.

We’re headquartered in the UK, and backed by some of the world’s leading investors including Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Balderton Capital, Accel Partners, Notion Capital and Bain Capital. Over 500 employees worldwide have decided to develop their careers with us. We’ve built a friendly, collaborative culture where we hire and develop people who share our desire to do work we can be proud of. We value learning and feedback, and support colleagues to develop in their role and more broadly in their career.




The role




We are expanding our team of Analytics Engineers, from junior-level to Principal. As an experienced data professional you’ll bring your expertise to bear on our growing business, building out our data capabilities. Your key contribution will be to define and build GoCardless’s core data models to provide the foundations for BI excellence and downstream data-hungry teams and tools. You’ll create the underpinning models that enable deep insight into a fast-growing business and do so with scale and resilience in mind from day one. You’ll help people in all areas of GoCardless make better, faster, more data-driven decisions and develop an expert knowledge of all areas of our operation. 




You’ll sit in our Product Development team and will work with technical and non-technical people across the whole company. You’ll collaborate closely with our team of talented BI Analysts, designing and implementing the foundations they need to provide first class analysis to the business.




The main elements of this role will involve:




Developing coherent and performant data models that transforms large, complex and disparate datasets into the basis for explorable, understandable and accurate data products
Building end-to-end analytics solutions from ETL through to data modelling and on to front end dashboards
Collaborating with engineers to prototype, design and build pipelines which take raw data from production systems and deliver them in a format suitable for analytic workloads
Supporting people across the company to enable them to self-serve Business Intelligence through analytics tools - we’re using DBT and Looker at GoCardless. 
Building analytics tooling that fully leverages the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform and BigQuery
Collaborating with BI Analysts and other data teams to create a data architecture that powers their deep-dive analysis to both test specific hypotheses and generate new business insights
Collaborating with our team of Data Infrastructure Engineers to design and implement ingestion pipelines for new data sources, leveraging their tooling to expand the breadth of the GoCardless data warehouse




Who we’re looking for:




You can point to a solid track record as a developer of first class data tooling
You’re a self-starter - you take initiative in spotting opportunities and finding ways to solve problems with data
You’re used to sharing your technical work in a clear way to others around you
You can turn complex business requirements into scalable, robust, explorable data products
You’re good at quickly getting a grasp of any dataset that you’re working with
You’ll have experienced the technical problems of setting up self-serve analysis and be interested in the technology behind the scenes
You’ll be able to demonstrate how you have automated repetitive tasks and built robust ETL pipelines




Requirements:




You have commercial experience in a fast moving company
You have excellent SQL skills and experience of scripting languages like Python
Experience with Big Data technologies (e.g. BigQuery, Snowflake) and working with data at significant scale
You have a firm grasp of self-serve data tools like Looker, Tableau, QlikView or similar. We’re using Looker at GoCardless.
You can communicate your work clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
You are as comfortable sourcing data from third party APIs as you are with discussing data modelling approaches




Life at GoCardless




Diversity is hugely important to us and we welcome applications from those with disabilities and from under-represented backgrounds. Throughout our hiring and onboarding process we make any reasonable adjustments necessary to create a level playing field and continually look at how we can improve in this area. We also have active ‘employee resource groups’ (such a BEAM and Rainbow) that are supported and sponsored by members of our Exec team; they work to engage and inspire our employees on diversity & inclusion topics throughout the year.




We offer flexible working hours and remote working arrangements, enhanced parental leave and pension packages. You’ll also receive equity, because we believe having this ‘buy in’ is a vital part of building a successful business where everybody - regardless of their role - can make a valuable contribution.




Here at GoCardless we value flexibility, and throughout the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic we've listened to our global GeeCees to gain a better understanding of the positives and negatives of working remotely (which we've been doing since March 2020).




Their feedback helped us develop our 'Adaptive Working' model, rolling out mid to late 2021. It's built around three components: days in the office, remote working, and enhanced environments. This means teams will be able to come into a GC office between one and three days per week for collaboration and teamwork, with the rest spent working remotely to enable a healthy work/life balance. We’ll also be reimagining our office environments so they enhance the collaboration and socialisation aspects our GeeCees told us they value most highly.




We continually review this approach in conjunction with the changing restrictions in each of our locations; additionally we offer support to maintain wellbeing and comfort, including subsidised home office equipment, workstation assessments and a range of remote social activities you can dip in and out of whenever you fancy.

We are Zego - a commercial motor insurance provider that powers opportunities for businesses, from entire fleets of vehicles to self-employed drivers and riders. We combine best-in-class technology with sophisticated data sources to offer insurance products that save businesses time and money.




Since our inception, we have believed that the problem with traditional insurance is that it holds businesses back. It’s too expensive and time consuming, and it no longer suits businesses who use vehicles to earn money. Our products represent a solution to this problem for businesses based across the UK, Europe and beyond.




So far, we have raised over $200 million in funding and we were the first UK insurtech to be valued at over $1 billion. We were also the first to be awarded our own insurance license and recently won Tech Company of the Year 2020.

We optimise for simplicity and re-usability – all our data lives in one place and is made available via our data warehouse in Google BigQuery. 90% of day-to-day data-driven decisions are covered by self-serve analytics through Looker which gives data scientists the head space to focus on more impactful business questions and analyses.

When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there’s some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.

We’re headquartered in the UK, and backed by some of the world’s leading investors including Google Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, Balderton Capital, Accel Partners, Notion Capital and Bain Capital. Over 500 employees worldwide have decided to develop their careers with us. We’ve built a friendly, collaborative culture where we hire and develop people who share our desire to do work we can be proud of. We value learning and feedback, and support colleagues to develop in their role and more broadly in their career.




The role




We are expanding our team of Analytics Engineers, from junior-level to Principal. As an experienced data professional you’ll bring your expertise to bear on our growing business, building out our data capabilities. Your key contribution will be to define and build GoCardless’s core data models to provide the foundations for BI excellence and downstream data-hungry teams and tools. You’ll create the underpinning models that enable deep insight into a fast-growing business and do so with scale and resilience in mind from day one. You’ll help people in all areas of GoCardless make better, faster, more data-driven decisions and develop an expert knowledge of all areas of our operation. 




You’ll sit in our Product Development team and will work with technical and non-technical people across the whole company. You’ll collaborate closely with our team of talented BI Analysts, designing and implementing the foundations they need to provide first class analysis to the business.




The main elements of this role will involve:




Developing coherent and performant data models that transforms large, complex and disparate datasets into the basis for explorable, understandable and accurate data products
Building end-to-end analytics solutions from ETL through to data modelling and on to front end dashboards
Collaborating with engineers to prototype, design and build pipelines which take raw data from production systems and deliver them in a format suitable for analytic workloads
Supporting people across the company to enable them to self-serve Business Intelligence through analytics tools - we’re using DBT and Looker at GoCardless. 
Building analytics tooling that fully leverages the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform and BigQuery
Collaborating with BI Analysts and other data teams to create a data architecture that powers their deep-dive analysis to both test specific hypotheses and generate new business insights
Collaborating with our team of Data Infrastructure Engineers to design and implement ingestion pipelines for new data sources, leveraging their tooling to expand the breadth of the GoCardless data warehouse




Who we’re looking for:




You can point to a solid track record as a developer of first class data tooling
You’re a self-starter - you take initiative in spotting opportunities and finding ways to solve problems with data
You’re used to sharing your technical work in a clear way to others around you
You can turn complex business requirements into scalable, robust, explorable data products
You’re good at quickly getting a grasp of any dataset that you’re working with
You’ll have experienced the technical problems of setting up self-serve analysis and be interested in the technology behind the scenes
You’ll be able to demonstrate how you have automated repetitive tasks and built robust ETL pipelines




Requirements:




You have commercial experience in a fast moving company
You have excellent SQL skills and experience of scripting languages like Python
Experience with Big Data technologies (e.g. BigQuery, Snowflake) and working with data at significant scale
You have a firm grasp of self-serve data tools like Looker, Tableau, QlikView or similar. We’re using Looker at GoCardless.
You can communicate your work clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
You are as comfortable sourcing data from third party APIs as you are with discussing data modelling approaches




Life at GoCardless




Diversity is hugely important to us and we welcome applications from those with disabilities and from under-represented backgrounds. Throughout our hiring and onboarding process we make any reasonable adjustments necessary to create a level playing field and continually look at how we can improve in this area. We also have active ‘employee resource groups’ (such a BEAM and Rainbow) that are supported and sponsored by members of our Exec team; they work to engage and inspire our employees on diversity & inclusion topics throughout the year.




We offer flexible working hours and remote working arrangements, enhanced parental leave and pension packages. You’ll also receive equity, because we believe having this ‘buy in’ is a vital part of building a successful business where everybody - regardless of their role - can make a valuable contribution.




Here at GoCardless we value flexibility, and throughout the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic we've listened to our global GeeCees to gain a better understanding of the positives and negatives of working remotely (which we've been doing since March 2020).




Their feedback helped us develop our 'Adaptive Working' model, rolling out mid to late 2021. It's built around three components: days in the office, remote working, and enhanced environments. This means teams will be able to come into a GC office between one and three days per week for collaboration and teamwork, with the rest spent working remotely to enable a healthy work/life balance. We’ll also be reimagining our office environments so they enhance the collaboration and socialisation aspects our GeeCees told us they value most highly.




We continually review this approach in conjunction with the changing restrictions in each of our locations; additionally we offer support to maintain wellbeing and comfort, including subsidised home office equipment, workstation assessments and a range of remote social activities you can dip in and out of whenever you fancy.

As a Technical Lead, you take up a two-fold role. 




First of all, we bestow you with the responsibility of guaranteeing that the solution works – meaning that it solves the problem and generates value in a robust and cost-efficient way.

You have a solid understanding of how businesses operate and know how to use this knowledge to select the most suitable algorithm and architecture for the task at hand.

Excellent Software Engineering skills:
Pprogramming in Python. Certainly the basics should be familiar: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Seaborn, Spacy,... You also know what constitutes good (test-driven) code development, and are able to champion this in a team.
Building complex data pipelines and using distributed computing
Deploying machine learning solutions on the cloud
Working in a Unix environment
Using other tools and frameworks such as GIT, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, ...
Expert in every aspect of Data Science:
Understanding and using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
Wrangling all types of data sources in any shape or form
Finding meaningful and actionable business insights with exploratory data analysis and using statistical methods
Understanding and being able to translate business problems into data science problems and vice versa
Translating your expertise and findings to a variety of different business stakeholders
Knowing when not to use “traditional” data science, but revert to other techniques – and knowing the basic elements of such techniques.
Excellent communication skills. This includes written, oral and non-verbal communication.
A team player and mentor for more junior team members.
Willingness to tutor others about Data Science and your area of expertise
Able to collaborate with and mentor Junior Data Scientists, and give (non-)technical advice and direction.
Experience in project and account management

Capable of defining the scope and execution strategy for new projects




Nice to haves

About Netskope

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.

Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Extract data from various source systems inside and outside of Netskope and load it into our Snowflake data warehouse
Transform data in the warehouse using SQL, DBT, and other tools to create a data model that is consumable by Looker and other visualization tools

Work with the BI team on requirements to solve business data needs

Description

At RXNT, we think of ourselves as a backbone to the US healthcare system. Every day, we provide the digital foundation on which healthcare professionals serve patients, order medications and lab tests, bill insurance companies, and interact with the wider healthcare community.

22 years of blood, sweat, and tears have taught us that this pursuit comes with great responsibility. It’s in the best interest of everyone if we hold ourselves to high standards, think rigorously, and at times, act urgently.

As a member of RXNT’s Practice Management team, you’ll work at the convoluted intersection where patients, providers, insurance companies, and medical billers meet to charge, transact, and settle disputes. The complexity of this space and shortcomings of old technology have led RXNT to emerge as a disruptor; we take pride in creating a seamless experience for users and pay attention to the vast potential for optimization.

We’re looking for self-motivated people who love to learn, are comfortable in a fast-paced and quickly-growing environment, and who seek ownership.

What you'll be doing

As a Senior Analytics Engineer, you will design and implement data modeling, reporting, and queries for RXNT’s medical billing solution.
You will manage and extend RXNT’s customer-facing data warehouse models (BigQuery, DBT), write complex user-facing analytical queries, write and refactor transactional SQL Server queries, write SQL unit tests, improve data cleanliness, think in terms of data governance, and influence refactoring of SQL and noSQL tables/documents.
You will push for and maintain best practices, such as testing in DBT, performant SQL, and consistent code standards (e.g. Fishtown style guide).
You will communicate thoroughly with the product team, designers, engineers, and sometimes customers to understand user needs and nuances in RXNT’s data.
With the help of your engineering manager, you will often provide both optimistic and pessimistic time estimates for your work.
To a lesser degree, you will leverage data visualization tools like Data Studio or Tableau to help the team better understand customer data.

You might be a good fit if you

Have 4+ years experience as a data analyst, data engineer, or analytics engineer at an e-commerce or SaaS company
Consider yourself a “full stack data analyst”
Can communicate clearly and directly about complex technical topics
Have experience with DBT (ideally 1+ year)
Are proficient in writing analytical SQL and understand the difference between SQL that works, and performant SQL
Consider yourself a full stack data analyst

A home for data teams around the world. Think what Github did for Engineering Teams or Figma did for Design Teams ( Website , Product Tour , Docs )

Our Story: Built for the humans of data, by the humans of data

At Atlan, we started as a data team ourselves tackling problems like national level healthcare and poverty alleviation with data science ( TED talk ; Case Studies )

The problem: That's how we learn't how tough it was to scale data teams. Data teams are the most interdisciplinary teams ever created: Analysts, Scientists, Engineers, Business; Diverse people with their own tooling preferences and skillsets and ""DNA"" that need to come together and collaborate effectively. Leading to collaboration chaos.

We would be awoken with crisis calls every second day for the minutest of issues - from troubleshooting why number on a dashboard is incorrect to getting access to the right dataset! Atlan started as us building small tools to make our own data team more agile.

Over a couple of years, we made our team 6X more agile and went on to do amazing things like build India's National Data Platform used by its Prime Minister. (data for 500M citizens, built by an 8 member team, fastest project of its kind to go live in 12 months instead of projected 3 years)

Could the tooling we built for ourselves help data teams around the world? That's how Atlan was born. We're on the mission to help data teams around the world do their lives' best work.

Här på Akademiska sjukhuset tror vi att ärlighet varar längst. Så svart på vitt: Vi vet att tempot är högt och att vi är i behov av fler kollegor. De tjänster som vi erbjuder kräver mycket, men vi som arbetar här vet att jobbet också ger så mycket tillbaka. På Akademiska sjukhuset har du nära till specialistkunskap, forskning, utbildning och engagerade kollegor. Vi arbetar kontinuerligt med förbättring och utveckling, och strävar efter att vara en hälsofrämjande arbetsplats med gott ledarskap och flexibla arbetssätt.

Vår verksamhet

Sektionen för Barn- och ungdomspsykiatri riktar sig till barn och ungdomar i åldrarna upp till 18 år och omfattar både öppen- och slutenvård. Affektiva enheten för barn- och ungdomspsykiatri är en öppenvårdsmottagning som tar emot barn och ungdomar med problematik som depression, ångestsyndrom som t ex PTSD och OCD, självskadebeteende, bipolärt syndrom och psykos. Vår enhet består av fem team: två team behandlar personer med depression och ångest och de tre övriga är ett bipolär- och psykosteam, ett DBT team och en könsidentitetsmottagning. På mottagningen finns även en grupp som behandlar personer med missbruk och samtidig psykiatrisk problematik.

Vi söker nu en psykolog med kompetens och intresse av att behandla patienter med OCD.

Ditt uppdrag

BUP:s uppdrag är att behandla patienter med OCD. En del av dessa är komplexa och har ofta en hög samsjuklighet. De svåra tillstånden kräver intensiva insatser och i dessa ärenden är man om möjligt mer än en behandlare som arbetar med patienten. Du kommer framförallt att arbeta med behandling, individuellt såväl som i grupp, och med bedömningar. Arbetet är teambaserat där flera professioner ofta samarbetar i ett ärende. Fokus är patienten i dess kontext varför samverkan med familj, skola, socialtjänst och övriga vårdgrannar är en naturlig del av arbetet.

Som nyanställd hos oss får du en mentor och introduktionsveckor. Du får också regelbunden KBT handledning. Mottagningen eftersträvar att arbeta evidensbaserat och utifrån standardiserade vårdprocesser. Då vi verkar på ett universitetssjukhus har vi medarbetare på mottagningen som forskar. Det förekommer också både interna och externa utbildningar.

Din kompetens

Du sätter alltid patienten i fokus och är ansvarstagande och motiverad i ditt arbete. Du är legitimerad KBT-psykolog gärna specialist eller med psykoterapeututbildning. Du är inte bara en skicklig psykolog, utan också en engagerad och positiv kollega som bidrar till en god arbetsmiljö. Har du detta kombinerat med nyfikenhet och noggrannhet kan du vara rätt för oss.

Vi erbjuder

Vi erbjuder en tillsvidareanställning på heltid, tillträde 2021-07-01 eller efter överenskommelse. Sedan maj 2021 har vi flyttat tillbaka till nyrenoverade lokaler på Kungsgatan. Arbetstiden är förlagt dagtid mån-fre. Inför tillsättning kommer utdrag från Misstanke- och belastningsregister att tas.

A home for data teams around the world. Think what Github did for Engineering Teams or Figma did for Design Teams ( Website , Product Tour , Docs )

Our Story: Built for the humans of data, by the humans of data

At Atlan, we started as a data team ourselves tackling problems like national level healthcare and poverty alleviation with data science ( TED talk ; Case Studies )

The problem: That's how we learn't how tough it was to scale data teams. Data teams are the most interdisciplinary teams ever created: Analysts, Scientists, Engineers, Business; Diverse people with their own tooling preferences and skillsets and ""DNA"" that need to come together and collaborate effectively. Leading to collaboration chaos.

We would be awoken with crisis calls every second day for the minutest of issues - from troubleshooting why number on a dashboard is incorrect to getting access to the right dataset! Atlan started as us building small tools to make our own data team more agile.

Over a couple of years, we made our team 6X more agile and went on to do amazing things like build India's National Data Platform used by its Prime Minister. (data for 500M citizens, built by an 8 member team, fastest project of its kind to go live in 12 months instead of projected 3 years)

Could the tooling we built for ourselves help data teams around the world? That's how Atlan was born. We're on the mission to help data teams around the world do their lives' best work.

Read our cofounder, Prukalpa's article about our vision for the future of data collaboration and our journey of failing 3 times before we figured out the real solution.

We were named a Gartner Cool Vendor in DataOps, one of the Top 3 companies globally (one of the fastest companies to make the list )

We're backed by iconic investors, including Sequoia Capital, Waterbridge Ventures and Mr. Ratan Tata

About Great Jones:

Great Jones brings ease and performance to rental ownership and living, starting by reinventing property management for the several trillion (!) dollars in rental homes owned by small-scale investors.

We're replacing an experience that has historically been heavily operational, low-tech, and stressful with one delivered through modern software, thoughtful experience design, real benefits of scale, and the right blend of local & centralized operations.

By providing a seamless, full-service experience for owners and residents, we aim to make ownership worry-free and more profitable for the 25 million Americans who own rental homes. In doing so, we become the operating system around our owners' most valuable investments, as well as our residents' homes.

And we're doing this within an enormous addressable market, with highly attractive unit economics, where competition is deeply fragmented and notorious for subpar service.

We are growing rapidly with nationwide expansion on deck -- headquartered in Manhattan with on-the-ground operations in 20 markets across 9 states.

Our leadership team has built digital platforms and operational machines that have powered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions for marketplace businesses like 1stdibs, Skillshare, and Warby Parker.

We've raised over $30 million (including our recently closed Series B) from top investors including Crosslink Capital, Navitas Capital, Zigg Capital, Juxtapose, and top NYC angels & real estate entrepreneurs including Kevin Ryan, David Rosenblatt, and Jason Finger, who have founded or led companies such as Seamless, Gilt Groupe, MongoDB, DoubleClick, 1stdibs, Floored, and others."

About Great Jones:

Great Jones brings ease and performance to rental ownership and living, starting by reinventing property management for the several trillion (!) dollars in rental homes owned by small-scale investors.

We're replacing an experience that has historically been heavily operational, low-tech, and stressful with one delivered through modern software, thoughtful experience design, real benefits of scale, and the right blend of local & centralized operations.

By providing a seamless, full-service experience for owners and residents, we aim to make ownership worry-free and more profitable for the 25 million Americans who own rental homes. In doing so, we become the operating system around our owners' most valuable investments, as well as our residents' homes.

And we're doing this within an enormous addressable market, with highly attractive unit economics, where competition is deeply fragmented and notorious for subpar service.

We are growing rapidly with nationwide expansion on deck -- headquartered in Manhattan with on-the-ground operations in 20 markets across 9 states.

Our leadership team has built digital platforms and operational machines that have powered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions for marketplace businesses like 1stdibs, Skillshare, and Warby Parker.

We've raised over $30 million (including our recently closed Series B) from top investors including Crosslink Capital, Navitas Capital, Zigg Capital, Juxtapose, and top NYC angels & real estate entrepreneurs including Kevin Ryan, David Rosenblatt, and Jason Finger, who have founded or led companies such as Seamless, Gilt Groupe, MongoDB, DoubleClick, 1stdibs, Floored, and others."

2637310594,"Hello, we are Atlan!

A home for data teams around the world. Think what Github did for Engineering Teams or Figma did for Design Teams ( Website , Product Tour , Docs )

Our Story: Built for the humans of data, by the humans of data

At Atlan, we started as a data team ourselves tackling problems like national level healthcare and poverty alleviation with data science ( TED talk ; Case Studies )

The problem: That's how we learn't how tough it was to scale data teams. Data teams are the most interdisciplinary teams ever created: Analysts, Scientists, Engineers, Business; Diverse people with their own tooling preferences and skillsets and ""DNA"" that need to come together and collaborate effectively. Leading to collaboration chaos.

We would be awoken with crisis calls every second day for the minutest of issues - from troubleshooting why number on a dashboard is incorrect to getting access to the right dataset! Atlan started as us building small tools to make our own data team more agile.

Over a couple of years, we made our team 6X more agile and went on to do amazing things like build India's National Data Platform used by its Prime Minister. (data for 500M citizens, built by an 8 member team, fastest project of its kind to go live in 12 months instead of projected 3 years)

Could the tooling we built for ourselves help data teams around the world? That's how Atlan was born. We're on the mission to help data teams around the world do their lives' best work.

Read our cofounder, Prukalpa's article about our vision for the future of data collaboration and our journey of failing 3 times before we figured out the real solution.

We're growing fast

We've grown 16X in just the last 6 months

We were named a Gartner Cool Vendor in DataOps, one of the Top 3 companies globally (one of the fastest companies to make the list )

We're backed by iconic investors, including Sequoia Capital, Waterbridge Ventures and Mr. Ratan Tata

Watch this 3 minute video of our journey so far where we're going (in conversation with Sequoia Capital).

We build with all our

We believe that data teams deserve fundamentally better software experiences.... Just because data is chaos, doesn't mean that work should be!

Love what Superhuman, Slack, Notion, Quip Figma have done for the modern workplace? Come build the future for data teams with Atlan.

Why this role is important for us?

Atlan helps growing data teams who've implemented a modern data stack to become significantly more agile. We integrate well with best of breed tools platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, Looker, dbt, and we are a core building block in the modern data platform ( Read more )
We ve grown 16X over the last 6 months. SEM and Paid acquisition channels have been an integral part of this growth and have helped us reach some of the best companies in the world.
We re looking for someone who can focus on Paid Marketing as a channel scale a working channel by 10X.

Your Mission at Atlan

Do keyword campaign research and keep your ear to the ground to identify new campaign opportunities
Run campaigns on platforms like LinkedIn, Quora, Reddit similar channels to complement our SEM strategy
Work cross-functionally with marketing, sales, customer success, and product teams to identify new messaging ideas, campaign opportunities, etc

What makes you a match for us?

WE ARE DEXT!

Our suite of tools makes accountants more productive, profitable and powerful. In doing so we give them back the most precious commodity, time, which they can then use to add greater value to their clients.

Accountants and bookkeepers are the backbones of every successful business. For more than a decade we’ve empowered our partners with innovative technology solutions to make businesses better. Dext allows them to meet the challenges they face today, tomorrow and in the future.

Our dev team is located in Bulgaria and has always been fully remote. We have people in Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, Varna, Ruse.

We're proud of the way we work and of our values – we care deeply about quality and sane development practices. We also strive for simplicity and pragmatism.

Architecture & Stack



Our systems are mostly done using Ruby on Rails. We use Python for machine learning. We have a large web app, a few smaller ones, a few mobile apps (Android and iOS), a growing fleet of services (in the sense of Service-Oriented Architecture) talking via HTTP.

Team, Challenges & You



The development team is mostly in Bulgaria. Because we’re a remote company we have people in Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas, Varna, Ruse. Everyone can choose where to work from.

We have reasonable processes, organised Kanban boards, stand-ups that don’t last more than 10 minutes and product owners writing detailed (sometimes a bit too detailed) specifications. We value highly the quality of the code and good practices. We’ve suffered enough without them. Our management is well aware of that. We’ve even had the need to explain that we don’t need so much time for paying back technical debt. Some of us even talk about those things (code reviews, automated testing, refactoring).

What We'll Expect If You Join Our Team


Write production-quality ELT code with an eye towards performance and maintainability;
Collaborate with colleagues to ensure that the business has all the data they need in a user-friendly structure;
Ensure that the BI team, domain analysts and data scientists have the modelled data they need to support the business - working with BI team and domain analysts to understand their data needs, and ensuring our data evolves to support them;
Coach analysts software engineering best practices - provide training to BI analysts and domain analysts on best practices in dbt, git, and data modelling, with a particular focus on driving an automation mentality;
Write clean, maintainable and efficient code;
Follow best practices (test-driven development, continuous integration, Kanban, refactoring and code standards);
Drive continuous adoption and integration of relevant new technologies into the design.

What Do We Seek




Our ideal candidate is someone who shares our love of quality and doing things the right way. Writing tests, structuring the abstractions cleanly and polishing the code until it shines should be their desire. We’re looking for good and experienced developers, who are not afraid to learn new things and work on hard problems. If this sounds interesting and you think we might “click”, get in touch with us.

What We Are Looking For


Demonstrable experience of working within a similar role in a fast-paced, high-growth technology (ideally SaaS) business;
An ability to conceptualise, build and develop tools that will streamline data discovery across Dext and increase knowledge sharing throughout the business;
A good understanding of clean code and data warehousing architecture;
Knowledge in modern data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery);
Strong system skills - excellent understanding of Python and databases is a must, along with strong SQL skills.


What We Can Offer


A friendly team of exceptional engineers and researchers, where you can thrive, learn and be productive;
Opportunity to work remotely from wherever you would like to;
Challenging problems to solve;
Freedom to choose stacks, technologies and tools.



If still not sure - we will be happy to give you a tour and tell you about our processes and work.

Benefits




Remote work is now the norm.

The difference is that we've been fully remote for many years now, and know how to properly work remotely. Additional benefits for our Bulgaria-based team include an employer-paid additional medical insurance, life and risk insurance, and 25-days of paid annual leave. There are additional compensation and time off for participation in the on-call rotation.

When there's no pandemic, the team gets together for monthly team drinks and an off-site somewhere beautiful twice a year. We hope to resume these activities as soon as the situation permits.

We strive for quality and a stress-free work environment.

We want our colleagues to learn and grow.

We’ll be happy to have a like-minded person join us!

What You Will Be a Part Of

We are a highly ambitious, innovative, market-leading FinTech. We are a global, well-funded business but have the dexterity and pace of a scale-up. We are uncompromising in our desire to achieve our best, day-in-day-out, and we have three clear values which guide everything we do

You’re outcome-driven. You believe what is measured is what is improved, but also that without a disciplined approach, the vast amount of available data and metrics has the potential to create distractions, misguided priorities, and inefficiency.

You’re eager to work with a passionate team that possesses the first party data of a large incumbent and the energy and culture of a startup. (In fact, we recently acquired and incubated two exciting new brands.)

Responsibilities:

Maintain an organized data warehouse and scalable, user-friendly reporting infrastructure.
Data Integrity: Ensure data presented in 3rd party tools, databases and reports are accurate and consistent.
Web Analytics: Measure and analyze website and marketing campaign performance. Identify trends, deficiencies, and opportunities across channels and throughout the customer journey. Build automated alerts to recognize and diagnose anomalies.
Attribution: Refine attribution models to provide better visibility into efficacy of all touchpoints in the customer journey. Surface new opportunities for profitable customer acquisition and retention.
Cohort Analysis: Identify and define valuable or high potential customer and merchandise segments for targeting and personalization. Leverage insights to improve acquisition, retention and LTV.
Predictive Modeling: Define and track leading indicators that allow the business to rapidly and proactively address changing trends and market dynamics rather than being reactionary.
Create self-serve reporting tools to allow key stakeholders to improve department efficiency and performance.

Bachelor’s degree or greater in computer science, business, mathematics, economics, statistics, management, accounting or a related field.
Adept at building succinct and actionable reporting and dashboards
Deep expertise in Google Analytics, Data Studio, BigQuery and SQL
